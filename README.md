# Flappy Bird

## About this Project
This project is an new take on an old game. Flappy bird was a very popular mobile game which had millions of downloads! This project provides the starter code to creating that very game in Python! Methodology is very similar to scratch. Complete the helper functions located in ```learner.py``` to add functionality to the game. In the end, you will have a fully functioning game of flappy bird. This project was designed to run within [replit](https://repl.it) as well as locally. To see the original project which runs locally see the local branch. Note the [replit](https://repl.it) project should work locally as well, however it hasn't been tested.
