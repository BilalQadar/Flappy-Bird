# Flappy Bird

#This project is an new take on an old game. Flappy bird was a very popular mobile game which had millions of downloads! This project provides the starter code to creating that very game in Python!
# Recommended: Check our the Cave Surfing game in Scratch. This game is the next step, designed to facilitate the transition from block based programming to written code!
#Learners should complete the learner.py file. Each function has a detailed docstring detailing what is required!
#Feel free to look through the other files which help render things to the screen!
